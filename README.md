# The Impact of Migratory Flyways on the Spread of Avian Influenza Virus in North America

This repository contains the data sets supporting the results of the following article:

Fourment M, Darling AE, and Holmes EC The Impact of Migratory Flyways on the Spread of Avian Influenza Virus in North America.

Data sets are organised by gene (i.e. PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and MP) and each folder contains:
* a fasta file containing the nucleotide alignment (**-dna.fa*)
* a tree file inferred from the nucleotide alignment (**.tree*)
* a fasta file containing the geographic location of each sequence (**-geo.fa*)


Other files:
* *countries.csv* contains the state/province to flyway assignment used in the study.

* *generate-models.py* is a python script that generates command line arguments for Physher
